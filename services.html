				I offer affordable and professional J2EE  custom web development services.  
				I always start development process  with interview, followed by written 
				documentation that includes project quote and project scope. In other words, project documentation will tell  
				you exactly, what system will do, what system will not do, and how much  it will cost you. For many projects, 
				documentations will, also, include  wire-frame representation of each screen with a description  
				what will happen on that particular screen. All of this is done to  protect best interests of my clients, 
				and to make sure that they get what they paid for.
