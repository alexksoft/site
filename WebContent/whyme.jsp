				<p>
					After more than 15 years in this industry I still love what Iâ€™m doing. I truly believe that creating a personal relationship with my clients is key
					to understanding my clients vision. Talking about client vision, it is absolutely essential that the people you talk to actually are the ones creating 
					your project, otherwise a lot of information will get lost in translation.  The benefit of going with freelance web developer, is that the person you 
					talk to will be the person who will engineer your website from start to finish.

					So if you looking for experience, creativity and easygoing business relationship, my Vancouver Web Development firm will wait for you call.
